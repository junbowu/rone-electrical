really should do:

* 1/tau = 1000hz=rc lpf on adc (room on board)
-- allow for .1 m Cap

* find logic-level p-channel mosfet with 10mohn Rds on

* jumper on current sense/JTAG lines (2 of them)
 


nice to have:



done:

* descriptive net names (done)

* connect rest to 430_reset (done)


not doing:

* SPlit analog and digital power (?? future board)
